We created a MEAN stack web application to get information about places around the users. First, they enter the place they want to find and they will be shown a list of related places near them. On clicking on a particular place more information will be provided to the users.
* The FourSquare Places API is used to find places near the users.
* Yelp API is used to find information about that particular place.

We provide the ability to save your favorite places and can access them easily through the web app. Also can find directions to those places through Google Maps.
